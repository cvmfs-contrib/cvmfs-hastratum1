#!/bin/bash
# Pull every CVMFS repository from its original source to a staging area,
#  then push each repository to a backup machine's staging area, and
#  finally make them available to be served to cvmfs clients, both on
#  this machine and on the backup one.  The pushing starts happening
#  for each repository in a separate process while pulling the next
#  repository.
# The data directory is shared between the staging and served areas, but
#  it doesn't hurt for extra data files to be available.
# If /etc/cvmfs/runstandalone does not exist and any errors happen when
#  updating the backup machine, updates are not made available to clients
#  from either machine.  In that way they stay in sync.
# If /etc/cvmfs/runstandalone exists, this still attempts to push most
#  of the files to the backup machine, but the updates will only show up
#  on the local machine.  Care must be taken to not allow the backup
#  machine to become the master before runstandalone is removed and the
#  backup is caught up to date.
# Repositories are assumed to be created by add-repository.  
# Ssh must have permission to run between the master and backup machines
#  as root without a password.  If using kerberos then put
#     host/other.host@DOMAIN.NAME
#  in ~root/.k5login on each machine where other.host is the full name
#  of the other host and DOMAIN.NAME is your kerberos domain name.
# Output goes to *-pull.log and *-push.log files in /var/log/cvmfs.
